description: "It has long been thought that the so-called \"Golden Ratio\" described in Euclid's Elements has \"implications for numerous natural phenomena... from the leaf and seed arrangements of plants\" and 'from the arts to the stock market.' So writes astrophysicist Mario Livio, head of the science division for the institute that oversees the Hubble Telescope."
